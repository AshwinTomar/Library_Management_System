Description:
This is a program I made for first year c++ training, it is far from perfect and may contain some bugs.
I have tried to fix most of them but if i find more, I will list them below or fix them.

**Note** 
Password asked in admin menu is 'Admin' .

Please do not add space when entering names or id of students,
instead of 'Ashwin Tomar' enter them as 'Ashwin_Tomar'.

The data from the program will be saved as a .dat file in same folder.
